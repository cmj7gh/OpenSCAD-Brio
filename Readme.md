This is a remix of two files:
- https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:43278 - created by srepmub
- Which was remixed in https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:142604 - by MobyDisk

To my knowledge, neither OpenSCAD file is available on GitHub. I intend to make some changes to these files, so I've copied MobyDisk's version as the first commit in this repo.
